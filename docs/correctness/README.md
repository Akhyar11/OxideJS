# Correctness Snapshots

This documentation stores correctness snapshots per version so that benchmark changes are always read alongside evidence that the model is still learning and core contracts are not broken.

## Goals

- Store correctness suite results run on specific versions.
- Create a pass/fail history for training paths and sensitive benchmarks.
- Serve as a companion to `docs/benchmark-sintetis`.

## Structure

- `README.md`: main index for correctness snapshots.
- `v<version>.md`: correctness snapshot for a specific version.

## Reference Command

The official repository correctness command is currently:

```bash
node -r ts-node/register test/correctness/index.ts
```

Combined suite command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Filing Rules

1. Create a new version file for each correctness snapshot to be frozen.
2. Record the command used.
3. Record the pass/fail status.
4. Record the relevant suite coverage.
5. If there is a failure, include a brief reason and the affected area.

## Versioning

The current active version of the project is `2.3.0`.

This project uses the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version format, such as `2.2.7`.

- The first number (`MAJOR`): significant changes that usually bring breaking changes or major architectural shifts.
- The middle number (`MINOR`): addition of new features or improvements that remain compatible with previous versions.
- The last number (`PATCH`): bug fixes, minor optimizations, cleanup, or minor changes that do not alter the main API.
